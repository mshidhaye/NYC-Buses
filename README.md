  <h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>I was hired by the New York Division of Transportation to explore NYC buses data to determine common delay or breakdown reasons, delay times as per companies as well as explored the correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdown or delays. </p>

  <h3>Business Questions</h3>
    <li>What are the common Delay Reasons?</li>
	<li>How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?</li>
	<li>Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?</li></ol>

  <h3>About the Data</h3>

  <h4>Common Delay Times</h4>

  <li> Delay times were high in the boros especially Manhattan.</li>

  <h4>Correlation between days of the week and breakdown/delays</h4>
 	<li>A decline was found in the breakdowns and delays as the week progressed from Monday towards Fridays.</li>
								

  <h3>Recommendations</h3>
  <li>Buses can be serviced regularly to avoid any mechanical breakdowns and subsequent delays.
  <li>Add more buses to the routes during peak times.
  <li> Offer various promotions to encourage commuters to use buses instead of cars.
